				<h3>Best in class security</h3>

					<ol>
					<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Private keys are never sent to the server except in an encrypted form.</span></li>
					<li>Everything is <a href="https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/omniwallet">open source from the ground up</a>!</li>
					<li>You can deploy the Omniwallet on your own server and host your own instance, or use one of the service providers that will host it for you – your money, your choice.</li>
